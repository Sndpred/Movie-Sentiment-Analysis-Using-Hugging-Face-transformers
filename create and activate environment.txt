PROJECT: Movie Sentiment Analysis with Fine-tuned DistilBERT

BUSINESS PROBLEM:
Analyze customer movie reviews to understand sentiment at scale

DATASET: 
- IMDB Movie Reviews (1,000 samples, balanced 50/50 pos/neg)
- 800 training, 200 test samples

METHODOLOGY:
1. Model Comparison: Tested 3 pre-trained models
   - RoBERTa: 60% accuracy, 1.05s
   - DistilBERT: 90% accuracy, 0.48s ⭐
   - Multilingual BERT: 80% accuracy, 1.21s

2. Fine-tuning: Customized DistilBERT on movie reviews
   - 2 epochs, batch size 8
   - Training loss: 0.347 → 0.154
   - Maintained 90% accuracy with better confidence

FINAL RESULTS:
- Accuracy: 90.0%
- F1-Score: 89.98%
- Precision: 90.26%
- Recall: 90.00%
- Speed: ~40 samples/second

TECHNICAL SKILLS DEMONSTRATED:
✅ Hugging Face Transformers ecosystem
✅ Model comparison and selection
✅ Fine-tuning pre-trained models
✅ Custom dataset preparation
✅ Training pipeline setup
✅ Model evaluation and metrics
✅ Production-ready deployment
✅ MLOps: model saving and versioning

PRODUCTION READY:
- Saved model: ./fine-tuned-distilbert-imdb
- Custom MovieSentimentAnalyzer class
- Batch processing capabilities
- High-confidence predictions (95%+ on clear cases)
